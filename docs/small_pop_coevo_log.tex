\section*{Time-shift assay replication}
Identified which replicates in both treatments had phage until T5 and T7. 

1-clone:
\begin{itemize}
	\item T5 = 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 ($N=8$)
	\item T7 = 1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 ($N=7$)
\end{itemize}

5-clone:
\begin{itemize}
	\item T5: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 9, 10, 12 ($N=9$)
	\item T7: 2, 3, 6, 7, 9 ($N=5$)
\end{itemize}

Face a trade-off between sampling from more timepoints but with a smaller $N$, or increasing $N$ but sampling from fewer timepoints. Conducted a power analysis using the \texttt{pwr} package in R. Derived reference Cohen's $D$ values from Morley et al (2018) (small effect) and Hall et al (2011) (large effect). 1-clone, small ES (0.57): $D\sub{1,6}=0.43$; 1-clone, large ES (1.28): $D\sub{1,6}=0.76$. 5-clone, small ES (0.57): $D\sub{1,4}=0.30$; 5-clone, large ES (1.28): $D\sub{1,4}=0.56$.
The smaller sample sizes are therefore appropriate, but bear in mind this only relates to within-treatment comparisons across timepoints. The unbalanced $N$ between treatments will have to be taken into account when making inferences about treatment effect.
