# Small Population Coevolution Experiment
### Jack Common

This experiment tested the effect of long-term extreme bottlenecking on coevolution between Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 and phage DMS3vir. Days 0-5 inherit from a related experiment (reported in Common & Westra 2018 RNA Bio).

This repo contains:
  - Original data files
  - Summary data i.e. phage survival data & coefficient tables
  - R analysis and figure generation code
  - Some Python scripts used to parse sequence data
  - Manuscript drafts and LaTeX build files
